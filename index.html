								<h2>LEADERSHIP EXPERIENCE<br />
								</h2>
								<p>Throughout my time at Sha Tin College, I have had numerous leadership opportunities and experiences. 
								This includes being a member of the student council, student leader for Dragon house, captain of numerous school teams
								such as the robotics team, and project leader for STC's Habitat for Humanity charity effort (A project in which
								students raise money throughout the school year through events, and in the end travel to China and use the money to build homes in collaboration
								with Habitat for Humanity). In all these activities, I have demonstrated the capacity to lead whilst also succeeding in them. I believe this makes
								me a suitable candidate for a digital leader.</p>

								<h2>Technological competence<br />
								</h2>
								<p>I have had multiple experiences with technology. I am not only the captain of the school's robotics team, but I have also had multiple 
								opportunities to work with professionals with technology: I made animations and worked stage lighting in CAS week with scottish opera, I had 
								summer internships in freelance website designing firms, and I have learnt coding myself and many other useful skills from IGCSE ICT. In addition to this,
								I have also made several website, including: <a href="http://jzdaboss123.github.io/">my graphic design portfolio</a>, <a href="http://jonathan.mrd333.com/">a website for a client</a>
								,and <a href="http://www.hkmeditation.com/">a website I am using for my own project</a> (This one is still in progress).</p>

								<h2>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />
								</h2>
								<p> To add on, I have also attended "Young Founders School" - a program that helped build up my confidence and presentation skills, and also a summer course at Brown University
								titled the "Brown Leadership Institute" in order to make me a stronger leader. I also attended a charity forum hosted by Kids4Kids, in which I pitched a charity idea and recieved
								$5000 funding for my project: this shows that I am confident and have well developed presentation skills.</p>

								<h2>MY IDEAS</h2>
								<p>As a digital leader, I have many ideas on how to use technology to improve our school.<br />
								In addition to these ideas, I would also like to hear from the students of STC about their ideas for the school.</p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-paper-plane-o">
									<h3>INSTANT TEACHER MESSAGING</h3>
									<p>As we all know, teachers may not always check their emails and their inboxes are constantly flooded. If a student needs a teacher's urgent help and guidance, this system will work wonders.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-laptop">
									<h3>ICT REPS IN EACH YEAR</h3>
									<p>I believe that something that would benefit our school is to have ICT representatives for each year, helping all students in the year with any possible technical difficulties.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>SUBJECT WEBSITES</h3>
									<p>I believe a website for each subject where students can contribute notes, resources and knowledge to help each other would heavily benefit our education.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-headphones">
									<h3>AUDIO NOTES</h3>
									<p>Subject faculties could create audio notes for students, so when students are commuting they are able to revise and study in a convenient manner, improving education.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-heart-o">
									<h3>MENTAL WELLBEING APPLICATION</h3>
									<p>It is common knowledge than IB and IGCSE are demanding for students. This app will ask students for their reflections and feelings each day, and will alert guidance counselors and teachers if there is cause for concern, protecting the mental wellbeing of students.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag-o">
									<h3>SCHOOL ROOM APPLICATION</h3>
									<p>An application in which students can view a map of the school to prevent them from getting lost, see which room they are in for class and google maps-esque features showing them how to get there, and a booking system so teachers and students know which rooms are free in case they need one for extra-curricular activities.</p>
